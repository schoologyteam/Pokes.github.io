## Running the Pretrained Model Interactively üéÆ  
üêç Python 3.10+ is recommended. Other versions may work but have not been tested.   
You also need to install ffmpeg and have it available in the command line.

### Windows Setup
Refer to this [Windows Setup Guide](windows-setup-guide.md)

### For AMD GPUs
Follow this [guide to install pytorch with ROCm support](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/radeon/en/latest/docs/install/wsl/howto_wsl.html)

### Linux / MacOS

V2 is now reccomended over the original version. You may follow all steps below but replace `baselines` with `v2`.

1. Copy your legally obtained Pokemon Red ROM into the base directory. You can find this using google, it should be 1MB. Rename it to `PokemonRed.gb` if it is not already. The sha1 sum should be `ea9bcae617fdf159b045185467ae58b2e4a48b9a`, which you can verify by running `shasum PokemonRed.gb`. 
2. Move into the `baselines/` directory:  
 ```cd baselines```  
3. Install dependencies:  
```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
It may be necessary in some cases to separately install the SDL libraries.
MacOS users will need to use ```macos_requirements.txt``` instead of ```requirements.txt```
4. Run:  
```python run_pretrained_interactive.py```
  
Interact with the emulator using the arrow keys and the `a` and `s` keys (A and B buttons).  
You can pause the AI's input during the game by editing `agent_enabled.txt`

Note: the Pokemon.gb file MUST be in the main directory and your current directory MUST be the `baselines/` directory in order for this to work.

### IDEs (ex. VSCode, Pycharm, etc.)

1. Copy your legally obtained Pokemon Red ROM into the base directory. You can find this using google, it should be 1MB. Rename it to `PokemonRed.gb` if it is not already. The sha1 sum should be `ea9bcae617fdf159b045185467ae58b2e4a48b9a`, which you can verify by running `shasum PokemonRed.gb`. 

2. Create conda environment:
```conda create -n (Name here) python=3.10```
Type y, then Enter/Return

3. Activate conda environment:
```conda activate (Name here)```

4. Switch to python 3.10
Press `Shift+Command+P`, Click `Python: Select Interpreter`, and select `Python 3.10`.

5. Change path:
```cd v2```

6. Install requirements:
```pip install -r IDE_requirements.txt```
You may have to use pip3

7. Train the program!
```python baseline_fast_v2.py```
You may have to use python3

8. Run the program!
```python run_pretrained_interactive.py```

## Training the Model üèãÔ∏è

### V2

- Trains faster and with less memory
- Reaches Cerulean
- Streams to map by default
- Other improvements

Replaces the frame KNN with a coordinate based exploration reward, as well as some other tweaks.
1. Previous steps but in the `v2` directory instead of `baselines`
2. Run:
```python baseline_fast_v2.py```

## Tracking Training Progress üìà

### Training Broadcast
Stream your training session to a shared global game map using the [Broadcast Wrapper](/baselines/stream_agent_wrapper.py) on your environment like this:
```python
env = StreamWrapper(
            env, 
            stream_metadata = { # All of this is part is optional
                "user": "super-cool-user", # choose your own username
                "env_id": id, # environment identifier
                "color": "#0033ff", # choose your color :)
                "extra": "", # any extra text you put here will be displayed
            }
        )
```

Hack on the broadcast viewing client or set up your own local stream with this repo:  
  
https://github.com/pwhiddy/pokerl-map-viz/

### Local Metrics
The current state of each game is rendered to images in the session directory.   
You can track the progress in tensorboard by moving into the session directory and running:  
```tensorboard --logdir .```  
You can then navigate to `localhost:6006` in your browser to view metrics.  
To enable wandb integration, change `use_wandb_logging` in the training script to `True`.

## Static Visualization üêú
Map visualization code can be found in `visualization/` directory.
